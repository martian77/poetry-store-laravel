# Poetry Store

This project is designed to allow a user to store copies of poems.

It is supposed to act like a personal poetry store, and not as a way to share these poems with other people.

It is also designed to explore [Laravel](/readme-laravel.md).

## Versions
Please note this is currently running Laravel 5.5.
