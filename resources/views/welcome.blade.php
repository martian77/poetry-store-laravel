                    <p>The poetry store is a place to store the poems you come across. Rather than have them scattered through books and websites and memories, they can be copied here with references back to their sources. You can rate them, and pull out your favourites or identify your preferred poets. You can tag them, and search for that poem on the tip of your brain that is just right for this occasion.</p>
                    <p>This is, however, a private store. To share the poem, you'll want to share the source - not this copy.</p>
